  <li>Every obtainable item in the game (except food combinations that's too much work XD)</li>
  <li>A LOT of cool builds</li>
  <li>Smelting Area</li>
  <li>Crafting Area</li>
  <li>Fishing Area</li>
  <li>Themed NPC housing</li> 
</ul>

AND MUCH MORE !!!

# How do i add the map?

Start by downloading the zip file called All items map.
Next step is to navigate to your "worlds" folder for Core Keeper.

![worlds folder navigation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124402987/216844866-b6fce9d7-8167-42f7-957b-ad58ab7c96f8.png)

After doing this, open the zip file you downloaded and place "1.world.gzip" in your CK worlds folder.
If you already have a world file that is called "1.world.gzip" you don't need to replace it, instead just raise the file world number to an empty one.
Example:

![File number](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124402987/216845775-30b8d60a-2434-4eba-94db-7d04a869a3b8.png)

In this case you would want to rename our world file to 5.world.gzip

# How do i add the map?

Start by downloading the zip file called All items map.
Next step is to navigate to your "worlds" folder for Core Keeper.

![worlds folder navigation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124402987/216844866-b6fce9d7-8167-42f7-957b-ad58ab7c96f8.png)

After doing this, open the zip file you downloaded and place 1.world.gzip in your CK worlds folder.
If you alredy have a world file that is called 1.world.gzip just rename our file to 2.world.gzip for example.
Have in mind that Core Keeper world files don't go from 1-8 like in game, instead they go from 0-7. Don't get confused by 0.world file, that one is actually your number 1 world in game.
